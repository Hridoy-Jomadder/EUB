                <h3 style="text-align: center;">ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</h3><br>
                <br>
                1. INTRODUCTION<br>
                The European University of Bangladesh (EUB) is committed to provide student centred learning environment aiming at producing competitive professionals who will be well-equipped with an integrated knowledge but also be scholars in their respective field of study and be future leaders of society. Academic policies and procedures are designed to regulate academic functions in the University with a view to provide conducive environment for teaching and learning. Policies and procedures are ‘generic’ implying that they should be applicable to all faculties and departments within the EUB. The policies are to be translated and procedures and to be tailored to the needs of the students and conform to the curricula and may therefore be varied from time to time as deemed necessary by the faculty/department authority.
                <br><br>
                At the early stage of its establishment, policies and procedures are being developed incrementally and amended as and when required to meet the needs of growing number of students. Given the diverse academic and social background of students, the EUB should remain flexible in designing, revising and implementing academic policies and procedures to provide adequate learning opportunities to students. The University authority reserves the right to revise and amend rules and regulations as and when necessary.
                <br><br>
                Students are responsible to know the academic policies and procedures of the University and also to comply with the same. Application of policies and procedures will not be relaxed for students who claim that they are unfamiliar to rules and regulations.
                <br><br>
                2. MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION<br>
                The medium of instruction is English. The EUB promotes a culture of intensive use of English as a language for teaching and learning while encouraging students to remain proficient in Bengali language and respect for mother tongue. Students are required to study compulsory English language courses aiming to improve their speaking, reading and writing skills and understand professional languages. Some students are required to take English remedial courses depending on their English Language competency level.
                <br><br>
                3. ACADEMIC CALENDAR<br>
                Academic year comprises three semesters. Each semester continues for 14 weeks plus study break and exam time.
                <br>
                • Fall Semester begins in the middle of September<br>
                • Spring Semester begins in the middle of January<br>
                • Summer Semester begins in the third week of May<br>
                <br><br>
                4. ADMISSION<br>

Prospective students and guardians are encouraged to visit nearest admission office to make well informed decision. Admission Offices open daily including weekend for extended hours. Main Admission Offices are located at the following addresses:
                <br>
                EUB Admission Office<br>
                EUB Permanent Campus<br>
                2/4 Gabtoli Mirpur Dhaka 1216<br>
                <br>
                Admission date<br>
                The EUB accepts application for admission all year round. Eligible students for admission are encouraged to complete admission formalities well before the commencement of their respective first semester. However, some students with financial difficulties and/or personal problems approach Admission Office to accept their application and grant admission after commencement of the semester study. Ideally, a new student should be admitted before the commencement of his/her semester study. However, considering EUB a new University, deadline for new intake for a semester may be extended to the end of third week of corresponding semester.
                <br><br>
                Admission requirement<br>
                Pre-qualification is one of the important determinants for admission in the EUB. Prior-learning /assumed knowledge is an additional criterion for admission in professional degree programs. Admission requirements for each program are provided in respective program syllabus in details.
                <br><br>
                Admission test<br>
                In addition to pre-qualification, the EUB conducts either formal or informal test to assess applicants’ competency in literacy and numeracy and also general aptitude. The University Administration in collaboration with the respective department will conduct oral or written test according to administrative convenience.
                <br><br>
