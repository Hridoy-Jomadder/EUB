Admission test will be conducted out of 200 marks and the distribution of marks is given below: </div>

            <br>
            8.3 Final Selection
            Students will be selected on the basis of results of the admission test.
            <br><br>
            9. Grading System
            Letter grading will be made to assess students’ performance. The grade will be assigned on the overall evaluation of a student’s performance on the basis of semester final examination, midterm exam, Case studies, tutorial test, term papers, assignment and class attendance in aggregate and whatever is applicable for an individual program. The teachers responsible for the course will determine Grades/GPA. The final result will be prepared by cumulating the grade point average over the courses. The UGC approved common grading system is adopted for assigning a letter grade and grade point. This is given in the following table:
            <br>

            * “F” means failure. Credits for courses with this grade do not apply towards graduation.<br>

            ** “I” grade is given to students who have fulfilled the majority of the course requirements but have been unable to complete the rest. The student is not required to register for the course in the next semester.<br>

            *** “W” means withdrawal. A student may decide to withdraw from a course by the deadline with the consent of the instructor and the Academic Advisor.<br>

            **** “R” means repeat. To improve grade say, F to D or better, more than two times repetition of a course is allowed.<br>

            ***** “Y” means audit. An existing student or ex-student may decide to audit a course of his/her interest for improvement of his knowledge for the particular course. In this case, the student pays the full tuition fee for the course, attends the classes, but is not required to sit for the exams and no credit is earned.<br>

            # Subject in which the student gets ‘F’ grades will not be counted towards credit hours requirements and for the calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA)<br>
            <br>
            10. Performance Evaluation of Courses<br>
            Final grade in each course will be given on the basis of the performance on class attendance & participation, continuous assessment, mid-term examination and final examination as indicated as under:
            <br>
            Calculation of GPA.<br>
            Grade Point Average (GPA) is the weighted average of the grade points obtained of all the courses passed/completed by a student. For example, if a student passes/completes n courses in a term having credits of C1, C2, … , Cn and his grade points in these courses are G1, G2, … , Gn respectively then
            <br>
            The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is the weighted average of the GPA obtained in all the terms passed/completed by a student. For example, if a student passes/ completes n terms having total credits of TC1, TC2, … , TCn and his GPA in these terms are GPA1, GPA2, … , GPAn respectively then
            <br>
            A Numerical Example<br>
            Suppose a student has completed eight courses in a term and obtained the following grades
            <br>
            Suppose a student has completed four terms and obtained the following GPA:
            <br>
            <br>
            Minimum Earned Credit and GPA Requirement for Obtaining Degree<br>
            Minimum credit hour requirements for the award of bachelor’s degree in engineering (B.Sc. Engineering) and other discipline will be decided as per existing rules.
            <br>
            Absence during a Term<br>
            A student should not be absent from quizzes, tests, etc. during the term. Such absence will naturally lead to reduction in points/marks, which count towards the final grade. Absence in the term final examination for any reason will result in an ‘F’ grade in the corresponding course. A student who has been absent for short periods, up to a maximum of three weeks due to illness, should approach the course teacher(s) or the course coordinator(s) for make-up quizzes or assignments immediately upon return to classes. Such request has to be supported by medical certificate from competent authority.
            <br><br>
            11. Symbols, Course Designation and numbering System<br>
            The undergraduate students of different years of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering have to follow the course schedule given below.
            <br><br>
            11.1 Course Types
            The courses included in the undergraduate curriculam are divided into the following groups:
            <br>
            a) Core Courses
            In CSE discipline, a number of courses are identified as core courses, which form the nucleus of the respective bachelor’s degree program. A student has to complete the entire designated core courses of his/her discipline.
            <br>
            b) Prerequisite Courses
            Some of the core courses are identified as prerequisite courses for a specific subject. A prerequisite course is one, which is required to be completed before some other course(s) can be taken.
            <br>
            c) Elective Courses
            Apart from the core courses, the students can choose courses from a set of elective courses. Elective courses are divided into computer science, software engineering, communication technology and computer engineering
            <br><br>
            11.2 Course Category
            The letter prefix in any course number indicates the discipline/subject offering the course.
            Letter symbols for course categories are:
            <br>
            Numbering System
            Each course is designated by a maximum of four letter code identifying the department offering the course followed by a three-digit number having the following interpretation:
            <br>
            The first digit corresponds to the year/level in which the course is normally taken by the students.<br>
            The second digit is reserved for departmental use. It usually identifies a specific area/group of study within the department.<br>
            The last digit is an odd number for theoretical courses and an even number for sessional courses.<br>
            The course designation system is illustrated by the following example.<br>

            <br><br>
            11.4 Credits Assignment<br>
            The assignment of credits to theoretical course is different from that of laboratory course, which is stated as follows:
            <br>
            a) For theoretical courses one lecture per week per term is equivalent to one credit.<br>
            b) for laboratory courses two class hours per week per term is equivalent to one credit.<br>
            c) Credits are also assigned to project work taken by the students. The amount of credits assigned to such work may vary from one discipline to another.<br>
            a) Course Structure (Regular Student)<br>
            The B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering Program consists of the following categories of courses:<br>
