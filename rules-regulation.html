                <b>Grade Report</b><br>
                Each student’s grade point average is numerical value obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the credits attempted. Only the courses graded A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D and F are used to determine credits attempted. In case students repeat courses, GPA and CGPA will be calculated on the basis of the grades obtained at the last attempt of the course (S) only. Grades obtained in course (s) in all examinations will be shown in the grade report. In addition, students who complete courses in addition to their normal credit requirements for graduation will inform the Registrar in writing about the course, which he intends to declare for consideration towards the requirements for the degree.
                <br><br>

                <b>The Incomplete:</b><br>
                The ‘Incomplete’ (I) grade is used in special circumstances. The ‘Incomplete’ may be given only at the end of a semester to a student who has completed all other requirements except the final examination.

                The student has the responsibility to take the initiative in making up the Incomplete as specified by the instructor. If action is not taken within three weeks of commencement of the next semester, the ‘I’ grade will automatically be converted into “F”. In the event, where the instructor from whom a student received an incomplete grade is not available, the disposition of the case-involving grade rests with the Dean of Faculties.
                <br><br>
                <b>Academic Probation:</b><br>

                A student must maintain a good academic standing with a CGPA of at least 2.00. Students with CGPA and (or) GPA of less than 2.00 will be placed on Probation. Students on Probation will be allowed a maximum of three semesters to earn CGPA and (or) GPA 2.00 or more failing of which will result in dropped from the program.
                <br><br>
                <b>Retake Policy:</b><br>
                A course passed with a grade less than B may be repeated to improve the relevant grade. When a course is repeated, the previous grade will be automatically cancelled. Students, failing in a course, will be allowed to repeat that course twice at the most on payment of course fee.
                <br><br>
                <b>Appeal for Grade:</b><br>

                A student not satisfied with the grade in any course may appeal to the course teacher. But if the grade is not improved and at the same time, the student is not satisfied with the explanation of the teacher concerned, he/ she may make a written request to the Chair of the department or Dean of the faculty. The Chair will review the process by which the grade was determined. After having the grade or answer script-rechecked, the revised final grade will be delivered. These procedures must take place within two weeks after the grade was published. Before making an appeal the student will have to make a payment of fee as determined by the university authority
